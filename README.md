# TasksMe
Journal your daily tasks and share with your team

Every day, Tasks Me emails members of your project, team, or company asking "What did you do today?" They can reply via email, then Tasks Me sends a summary of what everyoe else has gotten done. It can also remind you of what was accomplished one week, three months, or one year ago.

Requires: MySQL, PHP 5.6+, sendmail or some other outgoing mail service.
